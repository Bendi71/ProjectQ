## Introduction

As a Quantitative Finance student, I am passionate about exploring and implementing quantitative models and strategies. This repository is a collection of projects that I have worked on during my journey, including backtesting environments, machine learning applications, value-at-risk models, and option pricing models.

## Projects

### Backtesting Environment

I have implemented a backtesting environment using the [backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com/) package. The environment includes a variety of strategies, and I am constantly working to expand and improve upon them.

### Machine Learning Projects

Currently, I am actively working on a trading algorithm using text mining and text analysis, that makes automatic trades based on Twitter sentiment. With these projects, I am aiming to implement my knowledge of machine learning models, like Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.  

### Value at Risk Models

I have developed ready-to-use Value-at-risk (VaR) models to estimate the potential loss in a portfolio under various market conditions. These models contribute to risk management and decision-making processes.

### Option Pricing Models

In this repository, you will find implementations of option pricing models. These models are essential for valuing financial derivatives and understanding the potential risk and return associated with options trading. Specifically, the pricing is primarily done using Monte Carlo simulation and binomial models, such as the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model.

## Getting Started

To explore and use the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bendi71/ProjectQ.git

2. Navigate to the project of interest and follow the instructions provided in the respective README files.

3. Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to the projects!
